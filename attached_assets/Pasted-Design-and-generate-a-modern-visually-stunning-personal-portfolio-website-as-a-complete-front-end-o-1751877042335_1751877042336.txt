Design and generate a modern, visually stunning personal portfolio website as a complete front-end-only React application using Vite and JSX. The site should not include any backend, API integration, or external databases. The content must be based entirely on the provided user profile and resume details.

The portfolio must reflect creativity, clarity, and technical skills. Use React functional components, Tailwind CSS or styled-components for styling, and integrate subtle animations with Framer Motion or CSS transitions to elevate user engagement.

Structure the site into these key sections:

Landing/Home Page

Include a bold hero section with a background animation, large introduction text like "Hi, I'm Akshita Jain", and a short impactful tagline like "Engineering Innovative Tech, Pixel by Pixel".

Include a professional photo placeholder and a smooth scroll-down button that transitions to the next section.

Add a minimalist navbar at the top with a glassmorphism or neon theme, and smooth scrolling navigation links.

UI and Design Requirements

The design must be highly impressive and clean, using modern UI/UX principles.

Use glassmorphism, neon glow, or soft shadowed cards for modern appeal.

Include animations such as scroll-triggered fade-ins, card hover effects, staggered entry of elements, and responsive layout transitions.

Ensure full responsiveness for all screen sizes.

Add animated SVGs, Lottie animations, or subtle background particle effects where suitable.

Use custom fonts and smooth transitions between pages.

Prioritize aesthetics while maintaining fast performance and clear readability.

The site must be fully written in JSX components with CSS-in-JS or Tailwind CSS styling. Avoid using class-based components or old UI frameworks. Ensure modular file structure and maintainable code. All animations should be smooth and not excessive.

Do not include any server-side code, backend APIs, or database logic. This must be a purely frontend React project built with Vite that showcases an exceptional, visually engaging developer portfolio.
